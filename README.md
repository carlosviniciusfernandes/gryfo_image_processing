# Gryfo Image Processing

This project is based on **Gryfo's FullStack Challenge**. The original one was to build a REST API using Flask for image processing, with a bare minimum frontend with a multiselect of the operation to perform on the image.

This version is modified as it not only have a REST API, but also a CLI for the image processing. Moreover, for the REST API, there is an additional challenge of not using web development frameworks (for educational purposes).
